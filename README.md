Project Title:
UN Climate Change Discourse Analysis (1970–2020)

📄 Description:
This project explores how the term “climate change” has been used and discussed in official speeches delivered at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) over a 50-year period (1970–2020).

Using the CQPweb corpus analysis tool, I conducted:

Frequency analysis to track how often the term appeared over time

Distribution analysis to observe patterns across decades

Collocational analysis to identify common words appearing near “climate change”

The goal was to understand how global discourse around climate change evolved in terms of urgency, framing, and political language.

This term paper was completed as part of the course “Doing Corpus Linguistics” at TU Darmstadt (Winter 2022/23).
